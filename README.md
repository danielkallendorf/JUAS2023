*N. Fuster-Mart√≠nez, D. Gamba, A. Poyet, G. Sterbini*

For the MAD-X workshop at JUAS 2023 we will be using the **MAD-X accelerator design software**, together with **Python** as scripting language and **Jupyter** as interface for the analysis. 

In order to be ready for the workshop please follow the [instructions](./installation_guide.md) **before coming** to JUAS to **prepare yourself** and **your laptop** for the course.

For the workshop we will ask you to download the last version of [this repository](https://github.com/fusterma/JUAS2023/zipball/master), where you will find one folder for each tutorial with the corresponding jupyter-notebook and .madx file to be completed during the workshop as well as the solutions.
