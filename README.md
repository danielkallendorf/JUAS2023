# MAD-X workshop JUAS2023
*N. Fuster-Mart√≠nez*

For the MAD-X workshop at JUAS 2023 we will be using Python as scripting language and Jupyter as interface. In order to full control and access to a MAD-X interpreter in python, the library **cpymad** has to be loaded at the start of the Jupyter-notebook.

In order to be ready for the workshop please follow the [instructions](./installation_guide) **before coming** to JUAS to **prepare yourself** and **your laptop** for the course.
